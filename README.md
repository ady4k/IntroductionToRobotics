# Introduction To Robotics

## Course at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Computer Science and Mathematics

Projects and homeworks for the Introduction to Robotics course.
Typical software work will be done in Arduino using C++ as the main language. 

### Courses
Folder where all the lectures will be placed, containing mostly theoretical information about this course.

### Laboratories
All laboratory and practical work, mini-homework exercices will be placed in this folder. There is a sub-folder for each laboratory done, will be updated weekly when I finish doing the mini-homework exercices.

### Homeworks
Main weekly homeworks and future projects, each having their own sub-folder with a detailed description about it. Description includes the requirements, a picture of the circuit setup, a YouTube link to a video showcasing its functionality in 4K (living up to my name) and some details about the solution.
